  <h1>Resource Usage Guide</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the Resource Usage Guide. Here's how you can interact with the resources:</p>
  
  <h2>GET or HEAD Request:</h2>
  <p>To retrieve information from an existing resource, use a GET request. If the resource exists, you will receive the resource content.</p>
  
  <h2>PUT Request:</h2>
  <p>To modify an existing resource, use a PUT request to the resource. Provide the updated data in the request body to make changes.</p>
  
  <h2>DELETE Request:</h2>
  <p>To delete an existing resource, use a DELETE request to the resource. This will remove the resource from the server.</p>
  
  <h2>POST Request:</h2>
  <p>To create a new resource, use a POST request to a non-existing resource. If the resource does not exist, the server will add the new resource.</p>
  
  <h2>List Resources:</h2>
  <p>To view a list of all available resources, make a GET request to the /list endpoint. This will return a list of all resources and their descriptions.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Remember to include the necessary headers and data in your requests to interact with the resources effectively.</p>
